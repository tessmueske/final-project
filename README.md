~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is Tess Mueske's final project for React.js! In this project, I have built a coffee index using a self-made db.json (citations listed below). I used React Router and useOutletContext, and I have several client-side routes with different endpoints (/about, /coffees, and coffees/new). Users are able to add their own coffee to the index for others to peruse. Thanks for reading!
